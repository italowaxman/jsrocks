	    					<p>The example above may look a bit confusing, but it is actually a TDZ violation too -- that is because <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/1376">default parameters are evaluated in an intermediate scope</a> which exists between the parent and inner scope of the given function. The <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> parameters are bindings of this (intermediate) scope and are initialized from left to right, hence when <code>a</code>'s initializer tries to read <code>b</code>, the <code>b</code> identifier resolves to the <code>b</code> binding in the current scope (the intermediate scope) which is uninitialized at that point and thus throws a <code>ReferenceError</code> due to the TDZ semantics.</p>
	    					<p>As another example, subclasses (created with <code>class x extends y {}</code>)'s constructors that try to access <code>this</code> before calling the <code>super</code> constructor will throw a TDZ <code>ReferenceError</code>. That is because as long as a subclass's constructor has not yet called <code>super()</code> its <code>this</code> binding is considered uninitialized. Likewise, if a subclass constructor execution reaches the end of the constructor code without calling <code>super()</code>, the constructor would (like any other constructor) implicitly try to <code>return this;</code>, which would then throw a TDZ <code>ReferenceError</code> as <code>this</code> is still uninitialized. Reference: <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/workingdocs/ES6-super-construct%3Dproposal.md">ES6 super construct proposal</a>. <em>(note, though, that this proposal is only two weeks old at the time of writing, so it may be changed or discarded altogether from the final ES2015 spec.)</em></p>
	    					<h2>TDZ is everywhere... Except in transpilers and engines</h2>
	    					<p>Currently, transpilers such as 6to5 and Traceur do not enforce TDZ semantics whatsoever -- there are open issues in <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/1382">Traceur</a> and <a href="https://github.com/6to5/6to5/issues/563">6to5</a>, and just to be pendantic, 6to5 attempted to ship a quick and dirty TDZ static checking feature but had to retract it immediately afterwards due to <a href="https://github.com/6to5/6to5/issues/527">various bugs in the algorithm</a>. There are quite a few reasons transpilers didn't give much priority to TDZ enforcing yet:</p>
	    					<ul>
								<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> identifiers that are covered by the TDZ semantics must have every read/write access operation wrapped by a runtime check in order to fully cover the TDZ semantics (see the nested scope example in the "gory details" section above). This issue can be worked around by having optional TDZ checking transformers that are only enabled in a development environment -- this should work fine as long as your code doesn't expect TDZ <code>ReferenceError</code>s being thrown in order to work properly (which should be a rare enough use case).</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>Cost/benefit:</strong> Implementing proper TDZ checking takes some time and effort that could be spent writing transformers for new features or improving existing ones.</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>It is impossible to catch all possible user errors</strong>: most transpilers' goal is to transpile <em>valid</em> ES.next to valid ES.current, so they expect you to know what you're doing. It would take a nearly infinite amount of time to try to catch all kinds of errors, gibberish and marginal error edge cases that an user can input into a transpiler.</p></li>
							</ul>
							<h2>And what about <code>var</code>?</h2>
							<p>The Temporal Dead Zone semantics can be very useful by providing error feedback to the developer instead of yielding unexpected results (as ES5 code may currently do) in cases where your code may accidentally access uninitialized bindings. Just be aware of these semantics when using a transpiler that does not enforce TDZ, as you may be writing broken code without knowing it.</p>
							<p>Or, just in case you're really afraid of TDZ -- which you shouldn't be, seeing as most of the time the errors will be clear and easy to fix once transpilers/engines implement the TDZ semantics --, you may as well keep using <code>var</code> for the time being which does not have TDZ semantics. <code>;)</code></p>
